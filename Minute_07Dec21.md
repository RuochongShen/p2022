## 1. NeuTomPy
**Content:** 
  - Found a toolbox for CT in Python: TIFF, metrics, basic algorithms, etc.
  - There are some problems installing the package: mkl-fft
  
**Note:** We can try to install / directly use some codes / use other packages or MATLAB instead.

## 2. IScore
Introduced the idea of Inception Score.

## 3. LaMa
Introduced a recent method for image inpainting and showed some outputs.

**Note:** We can try it on images where the metal locates on the bone.

## 4. Next steps
  1. Find different metrics of evaluation;
  
  2. Implement or use the code of classical MAR methods, like linear interpolation and beam-harden correction;
  
  3. Evaluate the metrics by running MAR on the gt scans, calculating the metrics and comparing with subjective evaluation.

## Additional Notes
