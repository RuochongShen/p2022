## 1. Summary
**Content:** 
  - Had a look at "Reduction of metal artifacts in x-ray CT images using a convolutional neural network"
  - Finished the remaining parts of CNNMAR: tissue processing, trace replacement and getting CNNMAR image
  - **However**, it looks like the results are not changed much from CNN images by adding these parts
  - Tried to generate more data for training (as what we discussed, add different metals to each image) but the laptop went into crash. My new laptop is expected to be sent in 2 weeks.


## 2. Next steps
  1. Check the code again, try to make some changes and at the same time, check the details in the images like the paper does;
  
  2. Try to generate more data, but maybe I'll read some other materials instead before my new laptop arrived.

## Additional Notes
