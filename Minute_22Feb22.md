## 1. Weekly report
**Content:** 
  CNNMAR implementation by Python: marLI, marBHC under parallel-beam geometry; CNN-MAR and CNN image.
  
  Fanbeam: astra-toolbox or Torch Radon
  
  Problems: 
  1. CNN input shape=(64, 64, 3) while imRaw, imLI, imBHC size > 64; require downsizing process
  2. Compare CNN image with groundtruth


## 2. Next steps
  1. Deal with the two problems
  2. Continue on CNNMAR: other parts, and if parallel-beam doesn't work well, use fanbeam instead

## Additional Notes
